I was able to be a lot more flexible when negotiating the rent because of using OpenRent and instead of paying lots to an agent I was able to pay for a cooker and extra plumbing/electrical work when I was right at the very end of my renovation budget.",

On the first morning after listing on Thurs afternoon I received 4 inquiries which resulted in 2 requests to view that same day, one of which turned into a done deal by 5.30 pm.",
